This project was written as a final project for a class over the course of a month
it is a text based room to room dungeon crawler that we made together to showcase that we understood the use of dictionaries, I/O files, Classes, and Functions
We have left it in its state from when we submitted it
The final boss was made to be the professor of the class and so of couse the attacks we gave him were inspired by things that happened during the course of the semester in that class
We hope to go back eventually and maybe make this into a fledged out game for fun. Feel free to explore the code, play and have fun viewing our work

The version of python used to create the game are listed at the bottom in comments

Other than that, the game helps guide you along most of the way but lets you make the picks. Yes, we did lock the higher tier weapons under harder difficulties.
We enjoyed making each weapon have its own special utility and different in their own way. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did makeing it.
